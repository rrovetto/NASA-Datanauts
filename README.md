# About the NASA Datanauts open data initiative
The NASA Datanauts (2016-2020) was an open data initiative formed in 2015 through the NASA Office of the Chief Information Officer.
Beginning in 2016, it consisted of yearly classes of selected applicants interested in data topics and utilizing NASA data.
NASA employees were part of the classes, some serving as subject-matter experts and mentors.
A goal of the initiative was to increase presence of women in data science, NASA, and STEM disciplines.

# About my involvment
I applied to the program in 2017 and was accepted into the Spring 2017 class. I gave a presentation on ontology ([purchase here](https://tinyurl.com/4ap2mvcs)), and attended regular meetings, and sessions. I worked with a NASA employee. The work eventually became a NASA Technical Memorandum. The images folder contains some screen-captures providing proof of my membership.
